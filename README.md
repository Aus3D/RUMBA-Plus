RUMBA+ is an updated version of the RUMBA 3D Printer control board, originally developed by [RepRapDiscount](http://www.reprapdiscount.com/). 

The RUMBA+ update is designed to address several shortcomings with the original design, and improve on the otherwise solid framework it presents. More information on RUMBA is available on the RepRapWiki page [here](http://reprap.org/wiki/RUMBA).

Some of the key improvements in the RUMBA+ design include:
* Full 12/24V Compatibility (original RUMBA had 16V limit on bed)
* Better, logic-level MOSFETs which generate less heat (can handle higher currents + safer & more reliable)
* Improved power supply circuitry, including:
  * 5V and 12V regulators completely overhauled for higher current + less heat
  * Automatic power-select between USB or 12/24V
* Higher quality screw terminals for power input / heated bed (higher current rating + easier to work with heavy-gauge wire)
* Dozens of smaller changes to improve reliability or performance - refer to the [release page](https://github.com/Aus3D/RUMBA-Plus/releases) for a detailed change history.

RUMBA+ boards are for sale in the [Aus3D shop](http://aus3d.com.au/rumba-plus). Additional documentation is available on the [Aus3D wiki](http://wiki.aus3d.com.au/RUMBA_Plus).

In keeping with the original RUMBA design, RUMBA+ is fully open source.
